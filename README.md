## Vitest VSCode Coverage Workspace Issue

Reproduction of VSCode coverage not working:

- `pnpm test:coverage` outputs coverage fine
- Using VSCode run tests with coverage passes but no coverage is reported
- See `without-workspace` branch to demo this working without a workspace

See https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/477
